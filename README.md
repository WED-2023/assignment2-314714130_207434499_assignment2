# 🐔 Chicken Invaders - Web Game Project

This is a JavaScript-based web game inspired by the classic Chicken Invaders, developed as part of a web development assignment. Players must shoot incoming chickens, avoid getting hit, and achieve the highest score before time runs out!

The soundtrack of the game is the original sound of Chicken invaders!
