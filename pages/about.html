    <h2>About the game</h2>
    <p>ðŸ§  Worms is a game based on HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript, in which you must shoot and hit the target without encountering an obstacle.</p>
  
    <p>ðŸŽ¯ The player's goal: to hit all parts of the target before time runs out.</p>
  
    <p>ðŸ›  Technologies we used:
      <ul>
        <li>HTML5 + CSS3 for design and display</li>
        <li>JavaScript for game control and interactions</li>
        <li>Canvas for dynamic drawing</li>
        <li>jQuery (later, if we use modals for example)</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
  
    <p>ðŸŽ“ The project was built as part of the Web Development Environments course, Ben-Gurion University.</p>
  
    <p>ðŸŽµ Also included are sounds for hitting an obstacle, hitting the target, and firing from the cannon.</p>
